# Data-Bases-2
My colleague and I attended at Politecnico of Milan the course "Data Bases 2". We created a project called "Telco Service Application" where a telco company offers pre-paid online services to web users. Two client applications using the same database need to be developed: one is the customer of the service and the other is the employee.
We used Eclipse with TomCat and MySQLWorkbench. In particular, we programmed using Java to create the classes of the entities of the components of the project and SQL to create the databases and the triggers to update the databases.
We also used JPA and EJB to create a link between the java classes and the databases.
